PirannaFS is a modern and extensible general purpose filesystem developed in
Python that uses a SQLite database to manage its metadata. The idea behind it is
to have a minimalistic core so the user can addapt it to its own personal
purposses throught a plugin system, allowing from a no-files, pure metadata
filesystem up to ACLs, copy-on-write, logging, network distributed or whatever
the user wants.

This project won the first prize at the Madrid edition and the first honorable
mention at the national edition of the V Free Software University Championship,
Spain 2011.
