PirannaFS is a modern and extensible general purpose filesystem developed in
Python and that uses an SQLite database to manage its metadata. The idea behind
it is to have a minimalistic and useless core so the user can addapt it to its
own personal purposses throught a plugin system, allowing from a no-files
filesystem up to ACLs, copy-on-write, logging, network distributted or whatever
the user wants.

This project won the first prize at the Madrid edition and the first honorable
mention at the V Free Software University Championship, Spain 2011.
